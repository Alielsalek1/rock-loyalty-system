run tany el apiKey validator
return all [authorize Roles("admin")] --> as they are all removed
some endpoints are prefixed admin/ and other are not (Admin only endpoints)
test emails sending (check the Frontend part as emails get redirected to frontend)

REFRESH TOKEN
you should add a refreshToken when you create a user not when logging in (fix for confirmEmail and login)
Implement the refreshToken part as it doesn't send anything to the frontend.

Fix the Socket exhaustion
receiptId must be unique when creating a transaction
Adjust the date for the Spend (Voucher) to match to format for the Earn (points)
update use doesn't follow the uniqueness constraint (doesn't matter because the user is here only for testing)
FIX Database See, Spend, Expire.
Fix IsUsed Function kolaha (mdrooba belgzma)
remove Expired refreshTokens, confirmEmail, ForgetPassword from the database.


Amroosha notes:
Create Voucher has an error when creating more than 1 voucher ('UNIQUE constraint failed: CreditPointsTransactions.ReceiptId')
