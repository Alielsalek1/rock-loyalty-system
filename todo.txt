input validation
focus on EmailService
run tany el apiKey validator
return all [authorize Roles("admin")] --> as they are all removed
some endpoints are prefixed admin/ and other are not (Admin only endpoints)
test emails sending (check the Frontend part as emails get redirected to frontend)

REFRESH TOKEN
you should add a refreshToken when you create a user not when logging in (fix for confirmEmail and login)
Implement the refreshToken part as it doesn't send anything to the frontend.

Fix the Socket exhaustion
make input validators for all endpoints DTOs
receiptId must be unique when creating a transaction
Adjust the date for the Spend (Voucher) to match to format for the Earn (points)
